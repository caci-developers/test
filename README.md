## 1) Introduction 
Laravel/WordPress Lead Gen Form
As part of the interview process, we would like you to create a simple 
Laravel application and WordPress plugin so that we may assess your core 
competency with the Laravel framework, WordPress functions, coding best 
practices, as well as basic PHP coding and security standards. We expect 
this project to take less than a day to complete, but you can spend more 
time if necessary. 

## 2) Project Brief 
You are building a simple CRM system for a client. The system will collect 
customer data and build customer profiles that the client can browse and 
manage. Customer profiles will exist inside of a custom Laravel dashboard 
adjoined by matching customer profiles on a WordPress website. 
 
## 3) Step 01
### A) Description
The client needs to collect data from potential customers via a simple 
website form and turn those submissions into a list of contacts. Create a 
form to collect the data and save it into the client’s Laravel database. 
 
The form should include the following fields: 
• Name 
• Phone Number 
• Email Address 
• Desired Budget 
• Message 

### B) Implementation
You will find in this repository the folder "Laravel-dashboard" containing
the project, you need to change in .env file these fields:
database name
username
password
after that you must create database with seed data using this command:
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
than install dependencies using this command:
composer install
and finally start your up, the next pictures login page and submission page

## 3) Step 02
### A) Description
Create a simple dashboard using Laravel that the client can use to 
log in and view the customer profiles that have been submitted using the 
form. Use Laravel Breeze to handle authentication. 
### B) Implementation

## 4) Step 03
### A) Description
The client needs a basic integration with their WordPress website 
that will allow them to export customer profiles from their Laravel 
dashboard and import them into their WordPress website as WordPress 
users. Add a button to each customer profile in the Laravel dashboard you
created with the text "Create WordPress Account.” Clicking this button will 
use an Ajax request to automatically create a WordPress user with the 
“subscriber” role on the customer’s website using the information in the 
customer profile. It should be possible from the WordPress website to 
identify which profile on in the Laravel database these new users belong to. 
Create a WordPress plugin to handle this Ajax request.
### B) Implementation
 
## 5) Step 04
### A) Description
The client also needs to be able to locate the matching customer 
profile in the Laravel dashboard while browsing users in their WordPress 
dashboard. Add a button to user profiles in the WordPress dashboard that 
have been imported from the Laravel dashboard. This button should link 
back to the matching customer profile in the Laravel dashboard.  
 
## 6) Step 05
### A) Description
Finally, create some high level PHPUnit tests for your Laravel 
application that will test if the form submission and customer profile export 
functions work as expected.
### B) Implementation

## 1) Motivation:
This is our master thesis project in [University of Ibn Khaldoun TIARET](http://www.univ-tiaret.dz/an/). The present projects and documents (please take a look to this document: [Master thesis repport](master%20thesis%20docs/Master%20Thesis%203D%20Secure%20Architecture.pdf)) aims to describe how to implement the 3D secure protocol according to the EMV standard and adapt it for the ecommerce market in Algeria, and also how to make the double authentication using SMS and email via one-time password (OTP), or other mechanisms.
To do this project, we have developed 5 web applications whitch are: Hanouti ecommerce, payment gateway, interoperability domain, Issuer domain(bank), acquirer domain(bank). We have used Laravel and JQuery framework and many many others open source tools to develop these web apps and to implement this architecture. I hope you to enjoy reading this thesis and testing the five web apps!!!.

## 3) About this project: (introduction from our thesis)
Until these days, for many hundreds of years or since the existence of the human being, people were shopping and sometimes traveled to do this to improve their lifestyles. Nowadays, fewer and fewer consumers want to travel to shop, through the Internet these consumers can do all their shopping without leaving their homes. This type of shopping is called e-commerce.
E-Commerce is becoming a useful service for consumers, but it is also an important component in the daily activities of merchants. It allows them to contact their customers and suppliers, advertise and even organize efficiently the invoicing and the distribution of their products and services. In addition, it reduces the operating and support costs of the business. However, the lack of security in web-based transactions and the ease with which the privacy of online communications can be violated are the main stumbling blocks of e-commerce.

Merchant online shop websites provide an easy target for attackers because they typically have limited funds and do not have dedicated personnel to monitor, update and defend their systems.  The attacks on businesses continue to rise each year. The challenge is to successfully integrate effective security measures and mechanisms to protect the business from being compromised by attackers. Effective security is important for the continuity of business, trust of clients, and compliance with industry-specific laws and regulations. One breach in security can cost a business a lot of money, even shut it down.
There are a lot of E-commerce security strategies and mechanisms, one of them is 3D Secure protocol. Which is a messaging protocol developed by EMVCo to enable consumers to authenticate themselves with their card issuer when making card-not-present (CNP) e-commerce purchases. The additional security layer helps prevent unauthorized CNP transactions and protects the merchant from CNP exposure to fraud. The three domains consist of the merchant/acquirer domain, customer/issuer domain, and the interoperability domain.

The documents of this project aims to describe how to implement the 3D secure protocol according to the EMV standard and adapt it for the ecommerce market in Algeria, and also how to make the double authentication using SMS and email via one-time password (OTP), or other mechanisms.

This document is divided into three main sections. The first section gives an overview of ecommerce and E-payment security (the state of the art), this section is organized as follows: the first chapter begins by a history of Ecommerce, following this by its types, its characteristics, and finally its pros and cons. In the second chapter we will show the security services or requirements, the different security models for E-payment using cards, the most famous protocols used in online shopping, and a detailed study of 3D Secure System and a summary of two alternatives that implement 3D Secure scheme.
The second section examines 3D Secure protocol components and messages, a general activity diagram of the protocol is outlined in this section, a detailed and explained steps of this protocol, and finally we will show the 3D Secure pseudocode.
In the last section, we have described our environment including hardware and software tools used, and we have analyzed and presented the different diagrams used to develop the three web applications for banks1, payment gateway, and merchant online shop. After that, we will present source code developed to implement our protocol, and by making a real demonstration, we have obtained comprehensive results proving our implementation.

### b. Software
We will present here the different tools that we have working with. All our services are most often created using free tools and open source technologies.
* **Laravel**
Is an open-source web application development framework written in PHP. It is created by
Taylor Otwell and released under MIT License. And it offers you rapid application
development following the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Laravel is a
framework which makes it easier for you to build professional yet powerful web applications
following much expressive, elegant syntax and architectural pattern.
* **Other tools**
We have also used: PHP as a server scripting language, and Linux Ubuntu as OS, and other tools like: phpMyAdmin, MySQL,Bootstrap, WampServer, Composer, Apache, Visual Studio Code (vsc), VirtualBox, Draw.io, HTML, CSS, JQuery, XML, SSL, RestAPI, JSON.

## 5) Web Apps developped
1. **Hanouti ecommerce**
To verify our implementation of 3D Secure protocol, we have developed this ecommerce website to make online shopping and it allows to their consumers to buy goods or services from a seller (Merchant) over the Internet using a web browser. The source code is in [source codes of web apps/hanouti folder](source%20codes%20of%20web%20apps/hanouti).
2. **Payment gateway**
To simulate a payment gateway, we have developed this web app, it allaws to us to verify the cardholder information, to send verification code, and to validate this code with the issuer domain. The source code is in [source codes of web apps/pgw_pfe3ds folder](source%20codes%20of%20web%20apps/interoperability_domain).
3. **Interoperability domain**
To simulate an interoperability domain, we have developed this web app to forward messages between issuer and acquirer domains. The source code is in [source codes of web apps/interoperability_domain folder](source%20codes%20of%20web%20apps/interoperability_domain).
4. **Issuer domain(bank)**
